## Usage Guide

### Adding a New Task
1. Tap the floating action button (+ icon) in the bottom right corner
2. Fill in the task details:
   - Title (required)
   - Description
   - Priority level
3. Press "Add Task" to save

### Managing Tasks
- **Edit Task**: Tap the "Edit" button on any task card
- **Delete Task**: Tap the "Delete" button on any task card
- **Complete Task**: Toggle the checkbox on the task card
- **Filter Tasks**: Use the segmented buttons at the top to filter between All, Active, and Completed tasks

### Task Priority Levels
- **High**: Red indicator
- **Medium**: Orange indicator
- **Low**: Green indicator

## Key Components

### Banner
- Displays app title and welcome message
- Shows total task count
- Material Design elevation for visual hierarchy

### Statistics Dashboard
- Quick overview of task status
- Color-coded statistics
- Responsive grid layout

### Task Cards
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Priority indicators
- Action buttons for edit and delete
- Checkbox for completion status
- Visual feedback for completed tasks

## Redux State Management

### Actions
- `addTask`: Create a new task
- `editTask`: Modify existing task
- `deleteTask`: Remove task
- `toggleComplete`: Toggle task completion status

### State Structure
```javascript
{
  tasks: {
    tasks: [
      {
        id: string,
        title: string,
        description: string,
        priority: 'LOW' | 'MEDIUM' | 'HIGH',
        completed: boolean
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Performance Considerations

- Efficient task filtering
- Optimized re-rendering with Redux
- Responsive UI components
- Proper component memoization

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add local storage persistence
- [ ] Implement due dates and reminders
- [ ] Add task categories/tags
- [ ] Include search functionality
- [ ] Add sorting options
- [ ] Implement data backup/restore
- [ ] Add dark mode support
- [ ] Include task sharing capabilities
- [ ] Add task notes/attachments
- [ ] Implement task recurring options
